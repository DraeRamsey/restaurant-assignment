# restaurant-assignment aka Leoni's Tapas: Part 2

  The aim of this project is to gain more practice with:
   DOM manipulation, npm, webpack, and modules.

  The goal here was to create a basic three page restaurant site with tabbed browsing. Dynamically render all of the sites content using vanilla JavaScript, and separate the functions/page loads into modules.

  Coming from a React background I'd say going back to DOM manipulation with pure vanilla JavaScript was challenging... and slow. If I ever have a similar project in the future, I'd say using a SPA framework is the way to go, but it's fun going vanilla nonetheless.
